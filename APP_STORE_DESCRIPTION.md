## App Review Notes

**For Apple Review Team:**

HomeKitTV is a HomeKit control application that requires HomeKit-compatible accessories to fully test.

Testing Instructions:
1. Launch the app on Apple TV
2. Grant HomeKit permission when prompted
3. If no HomeKit setup exists, the app will display "No homes available" - this is expected behavior
4. With HomeKit accessories, you'll see rooms, devices, and scenes
5. All UI navigation works without HomeKit for basic interface review

The app's core functionality (controlling HomeKit devices) requires physical HomeKit accessories on the same network as the test device.

Screenshots provided show the full functionality with a real HomeKit setup.

Contact jordan@example.com if you need assistance during review or have questions about testing.
